            This result far exceeded previous experiences Iâ€™ve had with 2â€“4
            week-long audits by individual companies. I highly recommend the
            Code 423n4 competitive audit approach for anyone starting a new
            project.

            Overall, I have to say you guys have some very smart folks and some
            of the findings identified are quite good! Definitely a much better
            experience than the traditional audit we had gone through.

            C4 contests attract new, unique and complicated projects so it is a perfect learning opportunity... Here projects seriously invest in their security so it is always a motivation to try my best to find bugs in their code.
