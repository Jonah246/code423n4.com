            This result far exceeded previous experiences Iâ€™ve had with 2â€“4
            week-long audits by individual companies. I highly recommend the
            Code 423n4 competitive audit approach for anyone starting a new
            project and propose that we use it again in the future as we roll
            out new smart contracts.

            [C4 is] a really cool way to upskill your auditing skills, and makes
            for a cool hobby/side hustle.

            Overall, I have to say you guys have some very smart folks and some
            of the findings identified are quite good! Definitely a much better
            experience than the traditional audit we had gone through.

          <p>
            Ability to review and learn about different projects of DeFi. C4 contests attract new, unique and complicated projects so it is a perfect learning opportunity compared to 2017 when most of the contracts were either ERC20 tokens or ICOs. Here projects seriously invest in their security so it is always a motivation to try my best to find bugs in their code.
